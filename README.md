# shinyapp_species_distribution
Hi guys, this is my first project for Shiny app related, it's basically a set of Shiny apps designed to help biologists with biodiversity monitoring and species distribution mapping. The apps allow you to analyze biodiversity data and easily create interactive maps to visualize species distributions using Leaflet. While these tools are still a work in progress and could use some improvements, they provide a simple way for researchers to explore and understand their data. I hope these apps help make your biodiversity research a bit more accessible and engaging as I continue to refine them.
